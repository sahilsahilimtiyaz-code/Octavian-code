# Android native runtime

This directory is the Capacitor 7 Android platform for the DeepSeek Harness mobile control surface. It targets API 35, requires Android 8.0 or newer, and packages only `arm64-v8a`.

## Build

1. Install the JavaScript dependencies from `app/` with Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0` and `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
2. Import the release-pinned ARM64 PRoot runner and loader as `app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libdsh_proot.so` and `libdsh_proot_loader.so`. Both generated files are intentionally ignored by Git.
3. For the official self-contained build, generate the ignored `app/src/main/assets/runtime/runtime-manifest.json` and `rootfs.bundle` assets from the same source revision before Gradle runs. Transaction `.bak` and `.part` files must not be present. A remote-only development build may instead set both `DSH_RUNTIME_MANIFEST_URL` and `DSH_RUNTIME_MANIFEST_SHA256` and omit the bundled runtime.
4. Run `pnpm run android:sync`, then build with Android SDK 35, NDK, CMake 3.22.1, JDK 23, and Gradle 8.11.1.

The Gradle wrapper JAR and Capacitor-generated files are not committed. Generate the wrapper with a trusted Gradle 8.11.1 installation when preparing a clean build machine. Do not store signing passwords, download credentials, API keys, database credentials, or tokens in Gradle files or `local.properties`.

## 团队统一签名（签名一致性）

所有构建变体（debug/release）统一使用团队共享密钥库 `dsh-mobile-team.jks` 签名，包名固定为 `com.octacode.agent`（`app/build.gradle` 的 `applicationId`）。这样任何开发者或 CI 产出的 APK 都可以互相覆盖安装，不会出现「应用签名与已安装版本不一致」的提示。密钥库与密码**严禁提交 Git**（`.gitignore` 已排除），按以下方式获取：

1. **本地开发**：向团队负责人索取 `android/keystore/dsh-mobile-team.jks` 与 `android/keystore.properties`（模板见 `keystore.properties.example`），放入 `android/` 目录后即可直接构建。
2. **CI 构建**：由 GitHub Secrets 注入 `DSH_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`，外加以下二选一（**优先分片**）：`DSH_KEYSTORE_B64_1`…`DSH_KEYSTORE_B64_4`（密钥库 base64 按顺序切成的 4 个 851 字符分片，手机复制不易丢字符，坏了哪片 Gradle 会点名），或单个 `DSH_KEYSTORE_BASE64`（完整 3404 字符）。构建时自动拼接解码使用。
3. **缺失即失败**：两者都缺失时 Gradle 配置阶段直接终止（fail-closed），防止有人用个人 debug 密钥产出签名不一致的 APK。

签名一致性校验：`python3 scripts/verify-apk-signature.py --apk <apk 路径>`，比对 APK 签名证书的 SHA-256 指纹是否与团队证书一致（指纹固定于脚本内，CI 构建后自动执行）。团队成员可先用该脚本校验收到的 APK 再安装。

## Runtime boundaries

- `MobileRuntimePlugin` is the only JavaScript bridge. Every bridge input is validated again natively.
- `MainActivity` opens without user login or Android device-credential authentication. Once the runtime is ready it launches the non-exported `HarnessActivity` directly; its native toolbar returns to the management settings surface.
- `RuntimeInstaller` verifies the embedded archive's declared size and SHA-256. Remote replacements accept only digest-pinned HTTPS manifests and archives. Pinned DNS results reject every private, loopback, link-local, ULA, unspecified, or multicast A/AAAA answer before those same addresses are used for the connection. Remote transfers persist only the matching app-private `rootfs-<sha256>.part` file across restarts and resume with Range. A resume must return HTTP 206 and an exact `Content-Range`; HTTP 200 or 416 triggers a clean download from byte zero. Network, TLS, and timeout failures enter an explicit error state and retain the bounded app-private partial. Installation otherwise uses random app-private staging paths, no-follow/create-new file operations, fixed size limits, and atomic renames.
- Absolute guest symlinks are rewritten as relative links inside the staged root. Relative links that normalize outside it are rejected. Tar hardlinks are delayed until regular extraction completes and may target only no-follow regular files inside the staged root.
- `libdsh_proot.so` and `libdsh_proot_loader.so` must come from the pinned runtime toolchain. Either file missing returns `RUNNER_UNAVAILABLE`; startup uses app-private links whose targets remain the APK native libraries, and downloaded executable code is never launched. Before a shell or Harness starts, the app probes the runner, selects the compatible seccomp profile, and adds only validated `/dev`, `/proc`, and resolver bind mounts that the device accepts.
- Ubuntu entrypoints are allowlisted fixed argument vectors. Harness always binds `127.0.0.1`; a per-start 256-bit credential protects HTTP and WebSocket requests before dispatch, and `HarnessActivity` blocks navigation and HTTP resources outside the same loopback origin.
- Shizuku is optional. The manifest declares the official `ShizukuProvider`; authorization and UserService connection remain separate visible states, and Settings exposes an explicit reconnect action. Once connected, its UserService starts only `/system/bin/sh` and exposes that process only through a visible terminal session. Binder or UserService death invalidates sessions. The bridge reports `connected=true` only when permission is granted and the UserService binder is live. This is Android shell UID access, not root and not a general-purpose remote ADB client.
- Reset first stops Harness and all PTY sessions, then removes only the app-private runtime tree without following symbolic links.
- Audit records are stored under `noBackupFilesDir` with directory mode `0700` and file mode `0600`. UTC daily files retain the 90-day boundary and contain only a timestamp plus fixed event and result enums.

The app does not expose an install-cancel bridge method. Destruction still cancels an active internal download. A digest-matching remote partial is retained for a later installation attempt; unrelated resume files and interrupted random staging workspaces are removed during the next install or reset. Download, verification, and extraction are distinct states, so a network failure cannot be presented as installation progress. Copying an explicitly embedded APK asset uses the `preparing` phase. Android loopback limits reachability but is not treated as authentication; the rootfs-packaged Node preload enforces the app-generated ephemeral credential independently of upstream browser-trust checks.
