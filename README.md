**DeepSeek Harness for Android** runs the full [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/dsh) agent environment — an Ubuntu userspace, Node.js, and the official Harness web console — directly on an Android phone. No root is required: the complete Linux environment executes inside [PRoot](https://github.com/proot-me/proot), and Harness is served on Android loopback and displayed in a navigation-restricted internal WebView.

## Highlights

- **A complete Linux agent environment on your phone.** Ubuntu 24.04 runs on device through PRoot. There is no cloud server, no remote desktop, and no account sign-up: the agent runtime and its web console run locally.
- **Official Harness web console.** The app packages the official `dsh web` frontend, adapted only for mobile viewport sizing and safe areas. Desktop-oriented DSH web plugins load through the standard Harness plugin loader and receive mobile-friendly layouts.
- **Works without rooting.** PRoot provides userspace containment on stock devices. An optional [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) integration adds a shell-level device terminal (`/system/bin/sh`) when you choose to authorize it. Shizuku grants Android shell privileges — never root.
- **Self-contained and offline-capable.** The release APK embeds a verified `rootfs.bundle` plus a signed manifest, so the runtime can be installed with no network connection. Remote, digest-pinned runtime sources are also supported.
- **Tamper-resistant runtime delivery.** Every manifest and rootfs image is verified by exact length and SHA-256 before use; downloads only accept HTTPS destinations, reject private-address DNS answers, resume with HTTP range requests, and extract with path-traversal and device-node protections. Promotion to an active environment is atomic.
- **Built-in and custom model providers.** Credentials for DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Groq, xAI, Mistral, and your own OpenAI-compatible endpoints are encrypted with the Android Keystore and injected only into the runtime process. They are never returned to the WebView.
- **Local-only by construction.** Harness binds exclusively to `127.0.0.1`. Each start generates a fresh 256-bit transport token that protects both HTTP and WebSocket requests; the token is held in process memory only and is never persisted or embedded in URLs.
- **Integrated terminals.** Use an Ubuntu terminal inside the PRoot environment and, optionally, a Shizuku-backed Android device terminal in the same interface.
- **In-app runtime self-check.** When the runtime misbehaves you do not need a working `bash` to find out why: the check probes the shell, Node.js, the sandbox launcher (including its executable bit), the Landlock probe, a real confined exec, two PTY smoke tests (bare and confined), writes into the guest data and attachments directories, and the ripgrep executable bit — and reports free space. Missing permission bits or directories can be repaired in place, without modifying any file content.
- **On-demand log reading and interpretation.** The diagnostic log (internal status codes and counters only) is readable inside the app in 64 / 256 KB tail windows; the runtime log offers 8 / 64 / 256 KB windows with keyword filtering and level colouring. When a diagnosed signature appears (missing credential, split module identity, plugin load failure, port in use), the UI states a conclusion and a next step instead of leaving you with raw text.
- **Optional background keep-alive and overlay ball.** A foreground service raises the runtime process's priority in the background — but it **cannot** stop the system from ending the process under memory, battery, or vendor policy. The overlay ball returns to the conversation on a short tap, opens a menu on a long press, persists its position, and comes back into view after a rotation.
- **First-run credential gate.** Until a model credential has been saved on this device, Harness is not opened (a conversation cannot work without a key) and you are taken straight to Models and keys. An explicit “I configured the key inside Harness — open anyway” entry remains available.

## How it works

The application has three layers:

1. **Management surface (Capacitor + React).** A native Android shell for runtime installation, service control, model provider settings, terminals, runtime sources, and reset.
2. **Native runtime layer (Kotlin).** Validates and extracts the rootfs, manages the PRoot runner and loader shipped as native libraries, supervises the Harness process and PTY sessions, and optionally connects to a user-authorized Shizuku UserService.
3. **Ubuntu runtime (PRoot).** A fixed, allowlisted entrypoint starts `dsh web` on loopback inside Ubuntu 24.04. A Node.js preload enforces the per-start token before any request reaches Harness, and the internal WebView is restricted to that same loopback origin.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture and security boundaries.

## Installation

1. Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/dphmoblie/deepseek-harness-android/releases) page.
2. Install the APK (allow installation from the trusted source when prompted).
3. Open the app and wait for the embedded runtime to be read, verified, and installed — no internet connection is required for the official self-contained build.
4. Add a model provider and API key in **Settings → Models and keys**, then start Harness.

When the runtime is ready, the app opens the Harness console directly and restores your most recent session.

### Requirements

- An Android 8.0+ device with an **arm64-v8a** (64-bit ARM) processor.
- Roughly several GB of free storage for the extracted Ubuntu environment.
- An API key for at least one supported model provider, or a compatible custom endpoint.

## Model providers

Built-in providers: **DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Groq, xAI, Mistral**.

You can also configure any OpenAI-compatible endpoint as a custom provider (base URL, API key, and model list). Credentials are encrypted at rest with the Android Keystore and are injected into the Harness process environment only; saving a configuration restarts a running Harness so the runtime state always matches what is shown in the UI.

## Optional Shizuku integration

Shizuku is entirely optional and never bundled:

1. Install and start [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) (via wireless debugging or the standard Shizuku setup methods).
2. Grant the permission prompt inside the app, then use the explicit **Connect Shizuku** action.
3. This feature is currently in the testing phase and may be subject to potential defects.

If Shizuku is unavailable, unauthorized, or disconnected, device-terminal requests fail explicitly; the Ubuntu runtime and Harness are unaffected.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `^22.19.0` or `>=24.0.0` with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 11
- Android SDK 35, NDK, CMake 3.22.1, JDK 23, Gradle 8.11.1
- The release-pinned ARM64 PRoot runner and loader (`libdsh_proot.so`, `libdsh_proot_loader.so`) from the Operit2 Android runtime toolchain — see [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for the exact upstream revision and hashes
- For the self-contained build: a `runtime-manifest.json` and `rootfs.bundle` generated from the matching source revision

### Web and Android build

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run build          # TypeScript check + Vite production build
pnpm run android:sync   # build and sync into the Android project
pnpm run android:open   # open in Android Studio, or build with Gradle
```

A development build may omit the bundled runtime and instead pin both
`DSH_RUNTIME_MANIFEST_URL` and `DSH_RUNTIME_MANIFEST_SHA256` to a remote
manifest. Full build instructions and the signing policy are documented in
[android/README.md](android/README.md).

### Checks

```bash
pnpm test          # Vitest unit tests
pnpm --dir scripts/runtime-profile install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts # plugin test dependencies
pnpm run test:scripts
pnpm lint          # ESLint, zero warnings
```

## Security and privacy

- **Loopback only.** Harness never binds to a non-loopback interface; the internal WebView blocks navigation and HTTP resources outside the loopback origin.
- **Ephemeral transport credential.** A fresh 256-bit token generated with `SecureRandom` protects every Harness start. It is never persisted, logged, embedded in a URL, or returned to JavaScript.
- **Credential storage.** Provider API keys are encrypted with the Android Keystore and leave the management surface only as process environment variables for the PRoot runtime.
- **Verified runtime supply chain.** Manifests and rootfs images are schema-validated, digest-pinned, and extracted with strict archive boundaries; resumable downloads fail closed on malformed ranges or unexpected responses.
- **Audit trail.** Native audit records live in the app-private no-backup directory with owner-only file modes, rotate daily in UTC, and retain 90 days. Records contain only fixed event/result enums — never URLs, commands, tokens, or terminal data.
- **No login, no tracking.** The app has no accounts, no advertisements, and no telemetry.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome at
<https://github.com/dphmoblie/deepseek-harness-android>.

When contributing, please keep changes scoped, add tests for new behavior, and
run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` before submitting. Security-sensitive changes
must preserve the boundaries described in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md); in particular, never weaken
loopback enforcement, digest verification, entrypoint allowlists, or the
Shizuku UserService contract.
