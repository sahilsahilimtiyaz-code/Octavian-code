# Third-party notices

This file records direct dependencies and the provenance of generated runtime
artifacts. Release builds must also generate and review a complete transitive
dependency inventory for the exact lockfile, rootfs, native binaries, and
Android artifact being distributed.

The Android build copies this notice, the application `LICENSE`, the configured
JavaScript dependency license texts, the full GPL-2.0 and AGPL-3.0 texts
applicable to the imported PRoot/Operit artifacts, and archived GPL-3.0 and
LGPL-3.0 reference texts into `assets/legal/` in the APK. The network tool
component group (see below) adds the Ubuntu package copyright files collected by
CI into `assets/legal/ubuntu-packages/`. This generated bundle does not, by
itself, satisfy the release-time review and corresponding-source requirements
for transitive Android dependencies or the Ubuntu, Node.js, DeepSeek Harness,
PRoot, and Operit runtime materials.

## Native runtime provenance

Release APKs package these renamed ARM64 files:

| APK file | Upstream output | SHA-256 of the current release input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lib/arm64-v8a/libdsh_proot.so` | `liboperit_proot.so` | `cb40a1ced11cee76569b4008a9e478c87883ce831152be4eb9570763b82e580d` |
| `lib/arm64-v8a/libdsh_proot_loader.so` | `liboperit_loader.so` | `f149774236db1e69b36cc1e4ed3866c7094db2eee52da0d4956aa63a9bb26929` |

Their source/build provenance is the Operit2 repository at
`https://github.com/AAswordman/Operit2`, commit
`dc4c3a9405dc7ed3ef69b2ac9a6ace65374d77cf`, especially
`tools/android-runtime/`. At that revision the tooling pins Termux PRoot
v5.1.107.78 and carries the Operit patch at
`tools/android-runtime/patches/termux-proot-operit-android.patch`. Operit2's
top-level license is GNU AGPL version 3. PRoot source headers permit GNU GPL
version 2 or, at the recipient's option, any later version.

The upstream Operit Terminal Core `LICENSE` file is preserved verbatim as
`operit-terminal-core-LGPL-3.0.txt`. Because that upstream notice abbreviates
the incorporated GNU GPL version 3 text, the APK also carries unabridged FSF
copies as `gnu-LGPL-3.0.txt` and `gnu-GPL-3.0.txt`. Terminal Core was consulted
as a reference; no Terminal Core source or binary is copied into this app, so
these three files are retained for traceability rather than asserted as the
license of the independently implemented terminal bridge.

The native ELF files and generated rootfs are deliberately absent from Git.
Redistributors must preserve copyright and license notices and provide the
complete corresponding source required for the exact binaries they convey,
including the pinned upstream source, Operit patch and any later changes, plus
the scripts and instructions needed to generate, install, and run the object
code. A link to an upstream repository or this commit identifier alone is not
a corresponding-source offer. This provenance statement records the imported
binary hashes; it does not claim that this repository currently performs a
bit-for-bit rebuild of them.

The prepared rootfs must retain Ubuntu package copyright data, the Node.js
license and bundled notices, the DeepSeek Harness license, and the licenses of
all copied npm packages. A remote rootfs is subject to the same obligations as
one embedded in the APK.

## Network tool component provenance

The embedded runtime adds a network tool component group so the agent inside the
guest can clone, diff, and commit: `git` (with its `/usr/lib/git-core`
subcommands), `curl`, `libcurl` and its transitive runtime libraries,
`libexpat1`, `ca-certificates` (including the generated `/etc/ssl/certs` trust
store), and optionally `openssh-client`. The binaries are taken from the
`ubuntu-24.04-arm` build runner, which is the same distribution and architecture
as the image, by `scripts/stage-network-tools.sh`; no `apt` runs inside the
image. Man pages, `/usr/share/doc`, and locales are not copied, and the perl
dependencies of `git` are intentionally excluded, so perl-based helpers such as
`git add -p`, `git send-email`, and `git svn` are unavailable inside the guest.

Because these components are conveyed as Ubuntu binaries, the APK carries the
distribution copyright files collected by `scripts/legal-notices.py` under
`assets/legal/ubuntu-packages/`, together with `inventory.json` listing every
package that contributed a staged file (including `ldd`-resolved transitive
libraries). `git` is GPL-2.0; the unabridged GPL-2.0 text already shipped as
`legal/licenses/proot-GPL-2.0.txt` covers it, and the corresponding-source
obligation is discharged under the same terms stated for the other GPL-2.0
artifacts above and in `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`. Stating the upstream URL and
package version alone is not a corresponding-source offer.
